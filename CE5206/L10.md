Transit Assignment Models and Software Packages

## 1. Transit Trips and Transit Assignment Models

### 1.1 Journey Components of a Passenger

- Access from an origin to a transit stop
- Waiting for a transit unit
- Riding in a transit unit
- Alighting a transit unit
- Walking between two transit stops
- Egress from transit stop to destination

### 1.2 Transit Assignment Models

A transit assignment model aims to predict passenger flow distribution on a transit network based on **a route choice behavioral assumption of passengers** for a given origindestination (O-D) passenger demand matrix.

**Three Aspects:**
- Characteristics of supply on transit networks and services
- Information about supply that passengers could have before and during their journeys
- Passengers' responses towards current situations given the related travel information

**Three Aspects**
- Frequency-based transit assignment models: Usually for transport planning.
- Schedule-based transit assignment models: Dynamic assignment.

## 2. Frequency-Based Transit Assignment Model

### 2.1 Assumptions

#### (1) Assumptions on Transit Network (Supply Side)

- The times associated with each walk link and each segment of a transit line are **constant and known**.

- At each node (stop/station) that is served by a line, **the distribution of headways of TUs of the line is known**, usually assume it is a uniform distribution.

- The inter-arrival time of passengers at each node (stop/station) **follows a given distribution** such as normal distribution.

- The information that is available to passengers while waiting at a node is **which line is about to arrive**.

#### (2) Assumptions on Transit Route Choice Behaviors of Passengers from an Origin to a Destination (Demand Side)

- All passengers at a stop/station boards the **first arriving** TU serving those attractive lines.

- **Each passenger behaves in a way that minimizes his/her total expected travel time from her/his origin to destination.**

### (3) Route Choice Behaviors for Car Drivers and Passengers

**Objective** : Minimize the total expected travel time from origin O to destination D

- **Car drivers :** Find a shortest path

  Select a path with the minimum total expected travel time from the set of all possible paths from origin $O$ to destination $D$.

- **Passengers :** Find an optimal routing strategy

  Select **a set of paths/trips** from origin $O$ to destination $D$ and **the vehicle that arrives first determines** which of the paths is actually used.

### 2.2 Routing Strategy and Trip/Path

Given a feasible strategy, an actual trip of a passenger is carried out according to the following mechanism:

**Step 0:** Set NODE to origin node.

**Step 1:** Board vehicle that arrives first among the vehicles of the set of
attractive lines at NODE.

**Step 2:** Alight at the predetermined node in the feasible routing strategy.

**Step 3:** If not yet at destination, set NODE to current node and return to
**Step 1**, otherwise the trip is completed.

- A **routing strategy** is a decision tree from an origin to a destination

  Each path from origin to destination in the decision tree is a feasible trip of passengers with a path choice probability

### 2.3 Transit Network Representation

Denotations

- Each link $a \in A$ in a transit network $G=(I, A)$ is characterized by the pair $(c_a, G_a)$

- $c_a$ is the **link travel time** (known & fixed)

- $G_a$ is the distribution function for the **waiting time** on link $a$.

- $I$ is the set of nodes in the transit network.

Assuming **uniform arrivals** of passengers at stops, the cumulative density function $G_a(x)$ of the waiting time distribution
$$
G_a(x) = \Pr(\text{waiting time} \leq x)
=
\frac{1}{\displaystyle \int_{0}^{+\infty} 1-H_a(x) \, \mathrm{d} x} \ \int_{0}^{x} \, 1-H_a(x)  \ \mathrm{d} x
$$

where
$$
H_a(x) = \Pr(\text{ headways of vehicles on link } a \leq t)
$$

Consider the probability density function $g_a(x)$ of the waiting time distribution:
$$
g_a(x) = \Pr(\text{ waiting time} = x) =
\frac{1}{\displaystyle \int_{0}^{+\infty} 1-H_a(x) \, \mathrm{d} x} \ \big[ 1-H_a(x) \big]
$$

For a link $a$ that does not involve waiting time, let
$$
G_a(x) = \Delta(x) = \Pr(\text{ waiting time} \leq x)
= \begin{cases}
0, & \text{If } x<0 \\ 1, & \text{If } x \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

Consider the probability density function $g_a(x)$ of the waiting time distribution:
$$
g_a(x) = \Pr(\text{ waiting time} = x)
= \begin{cases}
1, & \text{If } x=0 \\ 0, & \text{If } x \neq 0
\end{cases}
$$

**Simplification :** A node which has only one **incoming link** $a_1$ with $(c_{a_1}, G_{a_1})$ one **outgoing link** $a_2$ with $(c_{a_2}, G_{a_2}=\Delta)$ can be replaced with $a$ single link with $(c_a = c_{a_1}+c_{a_2}, G_a=G_{a_1})$

### 2.4 Expected Waiting Time and Link Choosing Probability

Denotations

- $A_i^+$ is the set of **outgoing links** at node $i$

- $A_i^+$ is the set of **incoming links** at node $i$

- $W(A_i^+)$ be the **expected waiting time** for the arrival of the first vehicle serving any of the links $a \in A_i^+$

$$
W(A_i^+) = \int_0^{+\infty} \prod_{a \in A_i^+} \big[ 1 - G_a(x) \big] \ \mathrm{d} x
$$

Let $P_a(A_i^+)$ be the probability that link $a$ is served first among the links in set $A_i^+$
$$
P_a(A_i^+) = \int_0^{+\infty} g_a(x) \prod_{a' \in A_i^+ \\ a' \neq a} \big[ 1 - G_a(x) \big] \ \mathrm{d} x, \quad \forall a \in A_i^+
$$

where $g_a(x)$ is
$$
g_a(x) = \Pr (\text{ waiting time on link } a = x)
$$

#### Special Cases
$$
\begin{align*}
W(A_i^+) &= \frac{\alpha}{\sum \limits_{a \in A_i^{+}} f_a}, \quad \forall \ a \in A_{i}^{+}, \quad \text{ where } \alpha > 0
\\
P_a(A_i^+) &= \frac{f_{\alpha}}{\sum \limits_{a' \in A_i^{+}} f_{a'}}, \quad \forall \ a\in A_{i}^{+}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\sum \limits_{a \in A_i^{+}} f_{a}$ represents the combined frequency at node $i$

Note:

- $\alpha = 1$ an exponential distribution of headways of TUs with mean $1/f_{a}$

- $\alpha = 0.5$ a constant headway of TUs with mean $1/f_{a}$ for TUs on the link $a$

### 2.5 MINLP Model I for Many to One Assignment with $\alpha=1$

We can develop a mathematical model that that can assign the passenger demand $\{g_i^{d}, \, i \in O \subseteq I \}$ to the transit links based on the **optimal routing strategy** for **a given destination** $d \in D$ (namely, **"many to one"** assignment)

$$
\begin{align*}
\min z_I (\boldsymbol{v}, \boldsymbol{V}, \boldsymbol{x})
  & = \sum_{a \in A} c_a v_a^d + \sum_{i \in O} \dfrac{V_i^d}{\sum \limits_{a \in A_i^{+}} f_a \, x_a}
\\
\begin{array}{c} \text{s.t.} \qquad \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \end{array}
  & \begin{array}{lll}
    v_a^d = \dfrac{x_a \, f_a}{\sum \limits_{a' \in A_i^{+}} x_{a'} f_{a'}} \cdot V_i^d,
      & \forall a \in A_i^+, \ \forall i \in O
      \qquad \text{link flow allocation}
    \\
    V_i^d = \sum \limits_{a \in A_i^-} V_a^d + g_i^d,
      & \forall i \in O
      \qquad \qquad \text{flow conservation at nodes}
    \\
    V_i^d \geq 0,
      & \forall i \in O
    \\
    x_a \in \{0, 1 \},
      & \forall a \in A
  \end{array}
\end{align*}
$$

where:
- $x_a$ : Binary variable to indicate whether the link $a$ should be chose

- $v_a^d$ : Passenger volume on link $a$ to destination $d$

- $V_i^d$ : passenger volume at node $i$ to destination $d$, and $V_i^d = \sum \limits_{a \in A_i^+} v_a^d$

- $g_i^d$ : passenger demand from node $i$ to destination $d$

- $f_a$ : TU's frequency on the link $a$

**Note :** This is a **mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP)**

### 2.6 LP Model for Many to One Assignment with $\alpha=1$

Introduce new decision variable :

- $w_i^d$ : **total waiting time** at node $i$

$$
w_i^d
= \dfrac{V_i^d}{\sum \limits_{a \in A_i^{+}} f_a \, x_a}
= \dfrac{\sum \limits_{a \in A_i^{+}} v_a^d}{\sum \limits_{a \in A_i^{+}} f_a \, x_a}
, \quad i \in O
$$

Then we will have the following **linear programming** problem:
$$
\begin{align*}
\min z_{LP} (\boldsymbol{v}, \boldsymbol{w})
  = & \sum_{a \in A} c_a v_a^d + \sum_{i \in O} w_i^{d}
\\
\begin{array}{c} \text{s.t.} \qquad \\ \\ \\ \\ \end{array}
  & \begin{array}{lll}
    v_a^d \leq f_a \, w_i^d,
      & \forall a \in A_i^+, \ \forall i \in O
      & (\text{dual } \mu_a)
    \\
    \sum \limits_{a \in A_i^+} v_a^d = \sum \limits_{a \in A_i^-} v_a^d + g_i^d,
      & \forall i \in O
      & (\text{dual } u_i)
    \\
    v_i^d \geq 0,
      & \forall i \in O
  \end{array}
\end{align*}
$$
Where the constraint $v_a^d \leq f_a \, w_i^d$ is a relexation of $v_a^d = x_a f_a \, w_i^d$

The dual form is:
$$
\begin{align*}
\max W_{LP} (\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{\mu})
  = & \sum_{i \in I} g_i^d \cdot u_i
\\
\begin{array}{c} \text{s.t.} \qquad \\ \\ \\ \\ \end{array}
  & \begin{array}{ll}
    u_j + c_a + \mu_a \geq u_i,
      & \forall a = (i,j) \in A
    \\
    \sum \limits_{a \in A_i^+} f_a \mu_a = 1,
      & \forall i \in O
    \\
    \mu_a \geq 0,
      & \forall a \in A
  \end{array}
\end{align*}
$$

### 2.7 Node Label Correcting Algorithm for Many to One Assignment with $\alpha=1$

#### (1) Pass I: Find the optimal routing strategy from each node $i$ to destination $d$

Denotations:

- $u_i$ expected travel time from node $i$ to destination $d$

- $f_i$ combined frequency at node $i$

- $c_a$ travel time of link $a$

- $S$ set of links have not yet been examined

- $\bar{A}$ optimal strategy

**Step 1.1: (Initialization)**

$$
\begin{align*}
u_j & := \infty, \quad i \in I - \{d\} \\
u_d & := 0 \\
f_i & := 0, \quad i \in I \\
S & := A \\
\bar{A} & := \varnothing
\end{align*}
$$

**Step 1.2: (Get next link)**

If $S = \varnothing$ then STOP.

Otherwise, find $a=(i,j) \in S$ which satisfies
$$
u_j + c_a \leq u_{j'} + c_{a'},
\quad \forall a' = (i', j') \in S
$$
It represents **the link nearest to the destination** is selected among the link not examined.

Then, let
$$
S := S - \{a\}
$$

If the time from node $i$ to the destination via link $a=(i,j)$ , not including waiting time at node $i$, i.e., $u_j+c_a$, is smaller than the current time associated with node $i$, $u_i$, link $a$ is included in the optimal routing strategy and $u_i$ and $f_i$ are updated.

**Step 1.3: (Update node label and optimal routing strategy)**

If $u_i \geq u_j + c_a$ Then

If $f_a \leq + \infty$ (waiting involved)

$$
\begin{align*}
& u_i := \frac{f_i u_i + f_a(u_j + c_a)}{f_i + f_a} \\
& f_i := f_i + f_a \\
& \bar{A} := \bar{A} + \{a\}
\end{align*}
$$

else $f_a = + \infty$ (no waiting)

$$
\begin{align*}
& u_i := u_j + c_a \\
& f_i := + \infty \\
& \bar{A} := \bar{A} + \{a\}
\end{align*}
$$

If $u_i < u_j + c_a$, go to **Step 1.2**

**Note that** we may have $f_i u_i = 0 \times (+\infty)$ when the label of node $i$, $u_i$, is improved for the first time, we adapt the convention $0 \times (+\infty) = 1$.

#### (2) Pass II: Assign demand according to the optimal routing strategy

**Step 2.1: (Initialization)**

$$
\begin{align*}
V_i^d & := g_i^d, \quad \forall i \in O \\
V_i^d & := 0,     \quad \ \ \forall i \in I-O
\end{align*}
$$

**Step 2.2: (Loading)**

Do for every link $a=(i,j) \in A$ in increasing order of $(u_j + c_a)$:
$$
\begin{align}
& \text{If } \ a \in \bar{A} \ \text{ then } \  v_a^d := \frac{f_a}{f_i} V_i^d, \ V_j^d := V_{j}^{d} + v_a \\
& \text{Otherwise } \ v_a^d := 0
\end{align}
$$

**Step 2.3: (Waiting time)**

Calculate the total waiting time at each node
$$
\begin{align}
& \text{If } \ f_1 \neq 0 \ \text{ then } \ w_i^d := V_i^d \cdot \frac{1}{f_i}, \quad \forall i \in I
\\
& \text{Otherwise } \ w_i^d := 0
\end{align}
$$

### 2.8 Solution Method for Many to Many Transit Assignment

Denotations:

- $G=(I,A)$ : a given a transit network

- $\{g_i^d : \forall i \in O \subseteq I, \ d \in D \subseteq J \}$ : OD matrix

- $\left \{v_a=\sum \limits_{d \in D} v_a^d : \ \forall a \in A \right\}$ : link flow

- $\{w_i^d : \forall i \in O, d \in D\}$ : waiting time

Given a transit network $G=(I,A)$ and OD matrix $\{g_i^d : i \in O \subseteq I, \ d \in D \subseteq J \}$, we can use the following method to find the optimal link flow solution and node-based total waiting time solution .

**Step 1:** For each destination $d \in D$, apply the above node label setting algorithm to get the link flow solution $\{v_a^d, a \in A \}$ and and node-based total waiting time $\{w_i^d, i \in O, d \in D\}$

**Step 2:** Calculate link flow solution:
$$
v_a = \sum \limits_{d \in D} v_a^d, a \in A
$$

### 2.9 User Equilibrium Conditions for Transit Network with Link Discomfort "Cost" Functions of Passengers

Denotations:

- $G=(I,A)$ : a given a transit network

- $\{g_i^d : i \in O \subseteq I, \ d \in D \subseteq J \}$ : OD matrix

- $\{c_a(v_a), \ a \in A\}$ : **generalized travel time** of passengers on a link is a function of passenger flow instead of "a constant".

- $K_d$ : Set of all feasible strategies from set of origins $O$ to a destination $d \in D$
("many to one").

- $h_{id}^{k}$ : Part of the OD demand $g_i^d$  that is assigned to the network using strategy $k \in K_d$

  $$
  \sum_{k \in K_d} h_{id}^{k} = g_i^{d}, \quad
  \forall \, i \in O, k \in K_d, d \in D
  $$

- $s_{id}^{k}$ : the expected travel time from origin $i \in O$ to destination $d \in D$ using strategy $k \in K_d$ of the OD.

- $u_{id}^*$ : the minimum expected travel time from origin $i \in O$ to destination $d \in D$.

#### **User Equilibrium (UE) Conditions**:

From an origin to a destination, any used strategies have the same expected travel time and the expected travel time of an unused strategy is not less than that of any used strategies.

$$
\begin{cases}
s_{id}^{k} = u_{id}^{*} & \text{If } h_{id}^{k} > 0 \\
s_{id}^{k} \geq u_{id}^{*} & \text{If } h_{id}^{k} = 0
\end{cases}
\qquad
\forall i \in O, k \in K_d, d \in D
$$

#### Convex Programming Model for the UE Conditions

$$
\begin{align*}
\min z(\boldsymbol v, \boldsymbol w) = & \int_{0}^{v_a} c_a(\boldsymbol x) \mathrm{d} x + \sum_{i \in O} \sum_{d \in D} w_i^d \\
\begin{array}{r} \text{s.t.} \quad \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \end{array} &
\begin{array}{ll}
  v_a = \sum \limits_{d \in D} v_a^{d}, & a \in A \\
  v_a^{d} \leq f_a \cdot w_i^d, & a \in A^{+}_i, i \in O, d \in D \\
  \sum \limits_{a \in A_i^+} v_a^d = \sum \limits_{a \in A_i^{-}} v_a^d + g_i^d, & i \in O, d \in D \\
  v_a^d \geq 0, & a \in A, d \in D \\
\end{array}
\end{align*}
$$

#### MSA Solving the Convex Programming Model

Method of Successive Average (MSA) Solving the Convex Programming Model (UE Transit Assignment)

**Step 0 (Initialization)** Find a feasible solution $(\boldsymbol{v}^{0}, \boldsymbol{w}^{0})$, where

- $\boldsymbol{v}^{0} = (v_a^0, a \in A)$ denotes a feasible vector of link flows $v_a$

-  $\boldsymbol{w}^{0} = (w_i^{0,d}, i \in I, d \in D)$ denotes a feasible vector of total waiting times at nodes.

**Step 1 (Find descent direction)** Set $𝑘 := 0$.

Compute $(\hat{\boldsymbol{v}}, \hat{\boldsymbol{w}})$ by applying the solution method for many to many transit assignment with the fixed link times $c_a = c_a(v_a^{k-1})$

**Step 2 (Update)** Set
$$
(\boldsymbol{v}^{k}, \boldsymbol{w}^{k}) :=
\left(1-\frac{1}{k} \right) \cdot \left(\boldsymbol{v}^{k-1}, \boldsymbol{w}^{k-1}\right) + \frac{1}{k} \cdot (\hat{\boldsymbol{v}}, \hat{\boldsymbol{w}})
$$

If the following criterion are satisfied, then STOP.
$$
\frac{
  \sqrt{\sum \limits_{a \in A} \left(v_{a}^{k}-v_{a}^{k-1}\right)^{2} +
  \sum \limits_{i \in I} \sum \limits_{d \in D} \left(w_{i}^{k, d}-w_{i}^{k-1, d}\right)^{2}}
}{
  \sqrt{\sum \limits_{a \in A} \left(v_{a}^{k}\right)^{2}+\sum \limits_{i \in I} \sum \limits_{d \in D}\left(w_{i}^{k, d}\right)^{2}}
} \leq \varepsilon
$$
Otherwise, go to **Step 1**.

## 3. Schedule-Based Transit Assignment Model

### 3.1 Assumptions

- The time varying O-D trip demand is given.
- All transit vehicles have a fixed capacity and operate precisely on schedule.
- All travelers have full predictive about present and future network condition.
- All travelers select paths that minimize the generalized travel time.
- Passenger queue at platforms according to the single channel first in first out (FIFO) discipline.

### 3.2 Schedule-Based Transit Network

#### Network

$$
\boldsymbol f = \big\{f_{r,s,p}(t) : \ \forall r \in N_r, s \in N_s, t \in T, p \in P_{r,s}(t) \big\}
$$

#### Path Generalized Time
