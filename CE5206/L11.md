Operations & Management and Planning for Urban Public Transport High Ridership Corridors

## 1. Operations & Management for Urban Public Transport High Ridership Corridors

### 1.1 Urban Public Transport Corridor

#### (1) Definition of urban public transport corridor

**A public transport corridor** in an urban environment can be viewed as a linear or curvilinear (曲线的) concentration of land use activities in which significant travel takes concentration along a corridor with transit infrastructure and services provided.

**Example:** The North-South Corridor running from northern Singapore to the city center, which will be completed in 2026, will be Singapore's longest transport priority corridor (LTA). Bus passengers along the stretch will be able to cut travel times by up to 15 minutes.

#### (2) Objectives for Urban Public Transport Corridor Design/Planning, Operations & Management

- Cost reduction without compromising level of services Or

- Improvement of level of services without increasing cost

Four Specific Operational Objectives

- Increase TU operating speed
- Reduce vehicle-miles of services
- Reduce unnecessary slack time at terminals
- Maintain high, uniform vehicle loadings on all segments/section

#### (3) Effective Urban Public Transport Corridor Design and Operational Strategies

Express services

- CBD orientation

- Zonal express (Split corridors into two or more zones)

- Limited stops on express segments

Local services

- Peak direction strategies

  - Short turns/lines
  - Restricted zonal
  - Semi-restricted zonal
  - Limited stop zonal

- Light direction strategies

  - Complete deadheading
  - Partial deadheading

#### (4) Local Services vs Express Services

Example: **Express Bus Service 188e** of Singapore is an AM-Peak uni-directional limited-stop express route from Choa Chu Kang Interchange to HarbourFront Interchange. Its parent route is 188 and has a weekend variant 188R

- Local bus service: 188 (Trip time: 84 mins)

- Express bus service: 188e (Trip time: 56 mins)

### 1.2 Conventional Express Services vs Zonal Express Services

Zonal Express Service

- The corridor is split into two or more zones
- A different express route is designed to serve each zone
- Speed increase-shorter travel time-lower operating cost
- Reduction in vehicle-miles-savings of buses
- Longer headways-Longer wait time

Issues in Designing Express Services

- CBD routing: minimize travel time on local streets
- Adding stops to express portion: minimize impact on capacity requirement and travel time
- Reverse commuting: maximize potential for reverse commuting demand
- Fares: Premium bus fares or not?
- Local service impacts: prolonged headways or even eliminated local services

#### (1) Short-turning Local Services

**Definition:** Two or more routes operating along the same corridor, in which the shorter routes are **completely overlapped** by the longer routes

Reduced operating cost due to the less running time
- Shorter waiting time for inner passengers
- Schedule coordination and adherence to encourage inner segment travelers to
use shorter routes

#### (2) Restricted Zonal Local Services

**Definition:** The corridor is divided into two or more zones, with a particular route designed to serve each zone

- Shorter travel time vs longer wait time
- No need for schedule coordination and adherence
- Corridor showing a **strong downtown orientation** is suitable
- Public information and acceptance concerns

#### (3) Semi-Restricted Zonal Local Services

**Definition:** Similar to restricted services, but permits picking up passengers once passengers alight

- Carry demand generated in inner zones
- Uncertainty for passengers traveling within the inner zones
- Public information and acceptance concerns

#### (4) Limited-stop Zonal Local Services

**Definition:** A hybrid of short-turn, zonal local and zonal express services

**Example:** The Wilshire Boulevard corridor of Los Angeles, [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilshire_Boulevard)

- Discourage inner segment travelers from using Route 308
- Reduce one-way travel by 12 mins
- Reduced vehicle-miles and operating cost
- Increased access time and wait time
- Cost neutral

### 2.3 Limited-Stop Bus Service Evaluation Model

**Inputs :**
- Number of buses deployed on the combined local and limited-stop services (importance of resource neutral)
- Frequency split between local services and limited-stop services
- Distance between stops and headway distributions
- Running times of local services and limited-stop services
- Weights of access time, wait time and in-vehicle time
- OD passenger demand matrix

#### (1) Bi-level Programming Approach

Upper-Level Optimization Problem:
Optimize Key Performance Indicators of the System (Decision variables: headway / schedule of each service) subject to necessary headway / schedule constraints

Lower-Level Problem: Transit Assignment Model

Inputs of Supply and Demand for a Limited-stop Bus Service System

Execute The Frequency-based Or Schedule-based Transit Assignment Model/Software

#### (2) Key performance indicators (KPIs)

- Market share (Local preferred, Limited Preferred, Choice riders)
  - Prefer higher percentage of limited preferred riders

- Stop assignment (% of passengers at local/limited stops)

- Route assignment (% of passengers taking local/limited-stop services)

- Percent change in passenger travel time (weighted and unweighted)

- Productivity of operator (average passengers/trip or vehicle hour)
  - Proxy for peak load and cost effectiveness

#### (3) Experience from CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) Limited-Stop Services

**Inputs :**

- 5 limited-stop bus routes and 4 additional local services are being considered

- Average route length: 8 miles (range: 7.5 to 16 miles)

**Scenarios :**
- limited-stop services, maintaining at least 15 mins headway on local services

**Results :**

- Stop reduction: 60%-70% of exiting stops

- Running time reduction: 13%-26%

**Light Direction :** Demand in the light direction is only a fraction of peak direction demand

**Deadheading Strategies :** Running a bus non-stop and out-of-service from terminal to terminal in the light direction of travel

- **Complete deadheading :** Let all buses running on the short-turning routes deadhead

- **Partial deadheading** (for short headway services): Let a fraction of buses return in service while the remainder deadhead

## 2. Planning for Urban Transport High Ridership Corridors

Optimal Stop Spacing and Headway Determination for Urban Public Transport High Ridership Corridors

### 2.1 Four inter-related problem settings with **increasing generality**

1. A local/express bus service with equal stop spacing. Assumptions:
- (i) zero headway,
- (ii) infinite bus running speed and
- (iii) zero bus dwell time

2. A hierarchy urban public transport corridor system Assumptions:
- local bus service is provided as feeder to an express bus service

3. A local/express service with equal stop spacing and non-zero headway Assumptions:
- (i) maximum bus running speed is limited,
- (ii) bus dwell time is not zero and
- (iii) a single level of service (constraint)

4. A local/express bus service with equal stop spacing and non-zero headway Assumptions:
- multiple levels of service

### 2.2 An Idealized Analysis for the Limits to Door-to-Door Speed: A Single Line Case

#### (1) Assumptions

Assumptions:
- $H=0$ : Headways is zero
- $t_d=0$ : Bus dwell time at a bus stop is zero
- $v_{\max}=\infty$ : Maximum running speed of bus is infinite
- $v_a$ (e.g., 1 m/s) : Access speed of passengers (e.g., walk)
- $a_0$ (e.g., 1 m/s$^2$) : Acceleration/deceleration rate of bus

Denotations:

- $l$ : trip length, $l>>s$
- $s$ : stop spacing

#### (2) Model

**Objective:** Minimize the **door-to-door travel time of the worst-case passenger** by determining the **stop spacing** $s$, $t(s)$

Door-to-Door Travel Time: access time + (in-vehicle) line-haul time:

The optimization model is

$$
\min_s t(s) = \frac{s}{v_a} + \frac{2l}{\sqrt{s a_0}}
$$

where:
- $s$ : in the worst case, walking distance equals to stop spacing $s$
- The first additive term $s/v_a$ : access time in the worst case.
- The second additive term $2l/\sqrt{s a_0}$ : line-haul time, equals to $\left \lceil \frac{l}{s} \right \rceil \times t_s$, where $t_s$ is the riding time between two consecutive stops

The decision is a **trade-off for choosing stop spacing :** a longer spacing increases access time but allows buses to accelerate to higher speed and save in-vehilce time.

#### (3) Optimal Solutions

Stop spacing :
$$
s^{*}=\left( \frac{v_a^2 \, l^2}{a_0} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

Door-to-door travel time of the worst-case passenger :
$$
t(s^*) = 3 \left( \frac{l^2}{v_a a_0} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

Door-to-door travel speed of the worst-case passenger :
$$
\hat{v} = \frac{l}{t(s^*)}
= \frac{1}{3} (l \, v_a a_0)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

Door-to-Door Travel Speed $\hat{v}$ of the Worst-Case Passenger vs. Trip Length $l$

- Stops have to be spaced closely to facilitate passengers accessing

- Limited stop spacing prevents buses from achieving higher speed

#### 2.3 An Idealized Analysis for Hierarchical Transit Corridor Services

#### (1) Assumptions

Observations and Problems of previous model

- The optimal spacing for the single service case reveals that **long trips benefit from long spacings and short trip from short spacings.**

- Therefore, in situations where passengers take trips of widely different lengths, it makes sense to provide a local line that covers all the stations to serve the short trips, and an express line (service) that skips stations for the long trips. If this is done, **passengers with long trips could use the local line as a feeder to the express, in effect using transit itself to increase their access speed.** As a result of the faster access, they would enjoy an even higher door-to-door speed.

**Hierarchical system :** **A local transit service** with stop spacing $s_0$ is provided to decrease passengers' access time to **the express service** with stop spacing $s_1$

**In the worst case**, a passenger has to travel $s_1/2$ (first walk and then take the local service) to access to the nearest express bus stop and another $s_1/2$.

**No Hierarchy V.s. With Hierarchy**

| No Hierarchy                         | With Hierarchy                             |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| A single line                        | Local service plus express service         |
| Access speed equals to walking speed | Access speed is increased by local service |
| $v_a=v_w$                                     | $v_a = \hat{v}\left( \frac{s_1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{s_1}{2} \, v_w \, a_0 \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ |

According to door-todoor speed derived previously from : $v_a = \hat{v} ( l ) = \frac{1}{3} \left( l \, v_w \, a_0 \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$

#### (2) Model

$$
\begin{align*}
\min_{s_1} t_1(s_1) &= \frac{s_1}{v_a} + \frac{2l}{\sqrt{s_1 a_0}}
= \left[3 \cdot (2)^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot (v_w a_0)^{-\frac{1}{3}} \right] s_1^{\frac{2}{3}} + \frac{2 l}{\sqrt{a_0}} s_1^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\\
&=  A x^{n} +B x^{-m}
\end{align*}
$$

Where:
- $\displaystyle v_a=\hat{v} \left(\frac{s_1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} s_1 \, v_w \, a_0 \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$
- where $x:=s_1$

#### (3) Optimal Solutions

Stop spacing:
$$
s_1^{*} = \left(\frac{Bm}{An} \right)^{\frac{1}{m+n}}
$$

Door-to-door travel time :
$$
t_1(s_1^*) \approx 5.3 \left(\frac{l^4}{a_0^3 v_w} \right)^{\frac{1}{7}}
$$

Door-to-door speed :
$$
\hat{v} = \frac{l}{t_1(s_1^*)} = \frac{l}{5.3} \left( \frac{l^4}{a_0^3v_w} \right)^{-\frac{1}{7}}
$$

Door-to-Door Travel Speed $\hat{v}$ (the Worst-case Passenger) vs the Corridor Distance $l$

### 2.4 Realistic Analysis with Spatial-Temporal Effects for A Single Line Case

#### (1) Assumptions

**Remove** Some of Unrealistic Assumptions Made in Previous Analysis

1. Bus running speed is no longer infinite, i.e., $v_{\max} < \infty$. Bus running time is approximated by $s/v_{\max}$.

2. Bus dwell time is no longer zero, i.e., $t_d>0$, including time lost due to acceleration $\left(t_{(a)}/2\right)$ and deceleration $\left( t_{(d)}/2 \right)$

3. Bus headway is no longer zero, i.e., $H > 0$

Denotations:

- $\lambda$ (trips/h-km) : demand density. Assuming the passenger flow is uniformly distributed along the corridor.

- $c_m$ (\$/vehicle-km) : Costs on vehicle's depreciation, operation and management, etc.

- $c_t$ (\$/vehicle-h) : cost on crew wages, overhead, etc.

- $t_d$ (h/stop) : dwell time per stop, including acceleration and deceleration times

- $v_{\max}$ (km/h) : bus cursing at maximum speed

- $v_a$ (km/h) : walking speed of passengers

- $l$ (km) : trip length

- $T_0$ (h) : door-to-door travel time standards, refering to level of service.

#### (2) Model

Cost Minimization Model to Determine the Optimal Headway $H^*$ and $s^*$ subject to a given door-to-door travel time standard $T_0$

$$
\begin{align*}
\min_{H,s} \ & \pi(H,s) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & t(l) \leq T_0
\end{align*}
$$

where $\pi(H,s)$ is operator cost per trip (passenger)

Operator cost consists of **vehicles** and **infrastructure**
- Vehicle stopped (\$/vehicle stop): $c_s=c_t \cdot t_d$
- Vehicle moving (\$/vehicle-km): $c_d = c_{m} \times (1 \text{ km})  + c_t / v_{\max} \times (1 \text{ km})$
- Cost of guideway (\$/h-km): $c_g$
- Cost of a single station (\$/h) : $c_r$

Total operator cost accrued in running between two stations and stops at a station:
$$
c_d \cdot s + c_s + c_r \cdot H + c_g \cdot s \cdot H
$$

Total trips (passenger) generated between two stations:
$$
\lambda \cdot s \cdot H
$$

Operator cost per trip $\pi(H,s)$:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi(H,s) &= \frac{(c_d \cdot s + c_s + c_r \cdot H + c_g \cdot s \cdot H) \times (l/s)}{(\lambda \cdot s \cdot H) \times (l/s)}
\\
&= \frac{c_d}{\lambda \cdot H}
+ \frac{c_s}{\lambda \cdot s \cdot H}
+ \frac{c_r}{\lambda \cdot s}
+ \frac{c_g}{\lambda}
\end{align*}
$$

Door-to-door travel time of the worst-case passenger, $t(l)$
$$
t(l) = \frac{l}{v_{\max}} + t_d \cdot \frac{l}{s} + \frac{s}{v_a} + H \leq T_0
$$

It consists of

- In-vehicle time (moving + dwell) : $\frac{l}{v_{\max}}+t_d \cdot \frac{l}{s}$

- Access time: $\frac{s}{v_a}$

- Waiting time: $H$ (consider the worst-case passenger)

Proposition of the optimal solution:
$$
\frac{\partial \pi(H,s)}{\partial H} < 0
\quad \text{and} \quad
\frac{\partial t(l)}{\partial H} > 0
$$
Thus, the constraint must be bound at optimality.

#### (3)  Optimal Solutions

Write its Lagrangian with multiplier/shadow price $\beta(\$/h)$:
$$
z(H,s,\beta) =
\underbrace{\frac{c_s}{\lambda \cdot s \cdot H} + \frac{c_d}{\lambda \cdot H}}_{\text{Operator cost}}
+ \underbrace{\beta \cdot \frac{l \cdot t_d}{s} + \beta \cdot \frac{s}{v_a}}_{\text{Moving delay}}
+ \underbrace{\beta \cdot \frac{l}{v_{\max}} + \beta \cdot H}_{\begin{array}{c} \text{Passenger time cost} \\ = \text{Line-haul time(LH)} + \\ \text{Waiting delay(WD)} \end{array}}
+ \underbrace{\frac{c_g}{\lambda} - \beta \cdot T_0}_{\text{Constant}}
$$

Note that the infrastructure cost $\dfrac{c_r}{\lambda \cdot s}$ is excluded.

Omitting the first term $\dfrac{c_s}{\lambda \cdot s \cdot H}$ and derive the **approximated optimal solution in a neat closed form**:
- Headway: $H^* \approx \sqrt{\dfrac{c_d}{\lambda \cdot \beta}}$
- Stop spacing: $s^* \approx \sqrt{v_a \cdot t_d \cdot l}$

Given a specific $T_0$, the unique multiplier $\beta$ can be determined, i.e., one-to-one correspondence:
$$
t (l) = \frac{l}{v_{\max}} + t_d \cdot \frac{l}{s^*} + \frac{s^*}{v_a} + H^{*} = T_0
$$

### 2.5 ealistic Analysis with Spatial-Temporal Effects for A Single Line Case

#### (1) Assumptions

Cost Minimization Model to Determine Optimal Headway $H^*$ and $s^*$ subject to **multiple service standards**

#### (2) Modelling

$$
\begin{align*}
\min_{H,s} \ & \pi(H,s) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & t(l) \leq T_0(l), \quad l \in \mathcal{L}
\end{align*}
$$

Where: $\mathcal{L}$ is set of different trip lengths

At the optimality of this model, at least one constraint must be bound.

If we know the binding trip length $l_c$, this model is equivalent to
$$
\begin{align*}
\min_{H,s} \ & \pi(H,s) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & t(l_c) \leq T_0(l_c)
\end{align*}
$$
which is same to the model in Subsection 2.4.

#### (3)  Optimal Solutions

Enumeration method:

**Step 1:** Select one particular element of $l$ from its set $\mathcal{L}$

**Step 2:** Calculate $\beta$ from equation
$$
\begin{align*}
T_0(l) &= \frac{l}{v_{\max}} + t_d \cdot \frac{l}{s} + \frac{s}{v_a} + H^*
\\
&= \frac{l}{v_{\max}} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{t_d \cdot l}{v_a}} + \sqrt{\dfrac{c_d}{\lambda \cdot \beta}}
\end{align*}
$$

**Step 3:** Calculate
$$
H^* \approx \sqrt{\dfrac{c_d}{\lambda \cdot \beta}}
\quad \text{and} \quad
s^* \approx \sqrt{v_a \cdot t_d \cdot l}
$$

**Step 4:** Calculate door-to-door travel time for all trip length
$$
t(l) = \frac{l}{v_{\max}} + t_d \cdot \frac{l}{s^*} + \frac{s^*}{v_a} + H^*,
\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}
$$

**Step 5:** Terminate if $t(l) \leq T_0(l), \ \forall l \in \mathcal{L}$ is satisfied. Otherwise, go to **Step 1**.
