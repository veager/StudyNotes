## 1. Influential factors for public transport trip decision-making

- Availability: 
  - Spatial, Temporal, Information, Capacity
- Comfort and Convenience

### 1.1 Spatial Availability

The presence of **easily accessible** transit services **near** one's origin and destination (e.g., first-and-last mile issue)

#### (1) Walking Access

- Empirical studies: 75% - 80% walked 0.25 mi (400 m or 5 min walk) or less to bus stops

#### (2) Bicycle Access

- Bicycle facility availability and maintenance
- Bicycle parking security
- User demographics
- Climate
- On-board restrictions and rules

#### (3) Automobile Access

- Park-and-Ride
- Serve **lower-density areas**
- Case in Singapore: Cessation of park & ride scheme at 01 Dec. 2016.

- Types of Park-and-Ride (Classified by location or function)
  - Informal park-and-ride lots
  - Joint use lots
  - Park-and-pool lots
  - Suburban park-and-ride lots
  - Transit centers
  - Satellite parking lots

- Park-and-Ride Market Areas

### 1.2 Temporal Availability

#### (1) Service Frequency

- **Top factor** affecting overall trip satisfaction
- Short headways (10 min or less): passengers arrive randomly
- Long headways (15 min or more): passengers count on schedules

#### (2) Service Span

- The longer the span, the greater the variety of trip purposes can be served
- Traditional commute trips (shopping, social visits, medical appointments)
- Additional types of trips (work late, night class, holidays)

### 1.3 Information Availability

- Timely and correct information
  - How to use transit services
  - Where to access it
  - Where to get-off
  - Any transfers
  - Timetable
  - Service change or disruption
- Information channels
  - Posted maps, schedules, notices, signs
  - Audible announcements, visual displays
  - Online information
  - Smartphone (handphone) apps
  - On-site staffs
- Capacity availability
  - Passengers are forced to wait for the next
  bus or find another trip mode

Some interesting facts:
- In the *Seattle* area: Users with real-time information reported wait times that were 30% lower than users without it
- In *London* : 
  - 65% reported shorter wait times, although bus frequency did not change;
  - 83% felt that time passed more quickly;
  - 89% agreed that wait time was more acceptable with the information.

- Real-time information system reduced users' overestimation of wait time by 0.7 min.

### 1.4 Public Transportation Comfort and Convenience

#### (1) Passenger Load 

- **For passengers:** Crowded in-vehicle condition is more
onerous than non-crowding conditions, especially when they
have to stand.
- **For transit operators:** Slow down transit operations.
- A **compromise** between passenger comfort and moving as
many passengers as possible with the least number of
vehicles.

#### (2) Reliability

**On-time performance** vs **regularity of headway**

- Bus bunching: 
  - Irritating for both passengers and bus drivers
  - Bus services with longer route length, longer run times, a higher number of intermediate stops and shorter headway are prone to bus bunching

- Causes
  - Traffic and environmental conditions
  - Road construction and track maintenance
  - Evenness of passenger demand
  - Vehicle quality
  - Route length and number of stops
  - Staff and vehicle availability
  - Driving skill
  - Operations control strategies
    - **Schedule-based** and **headway-based** holding strategies

#### (3) Travel Time for Passengers

- Access time on both ends of a trip
- Wait time
- Transfer time
- In-vehicle time

Value of Time (VoT)

- The longer the trip, the more value the passengers will place on reducing travel time by a single unit of time
- A unit of time spent during **access, wait and transfer** is perceived as **more onerous** than a unit of **in-vehicle** time

#### (4) Others

- Safety
  - The potential for being injured

- Security
  - The potential for becoming the victim of a crime

- Cost
  - The cost of using transit service against other travel modes

- Appearance and Comfort
  - Clean and attractive vehicles/Amenities
  - Temperature control
  - Seat and ride comfort

- Customer Relation
  - Driver friendliness and helpfulness

## 2. Public Transport Service Measuring Methods

Measures of availability for fixed-route public transportation services
- Availability
  - Service Frequency
  - Service Span
  - Access (Walk, Bicycle, Automobile)
- Comfort and Convenience
  - Passenger Load
  - Reliability
  - Travel time


### 2.1 Service Frequency & Service Span

- Seven levels of Service Frequency: (details in Exhibit 5-2 of Ref [2] in page 5-4)
  - $\leq$ 5 minutes
  - 5 to 10 minutes
  - 11 to 15 minutes
  - 16 to 30 minutes
  - 31 to 59 minutes
  - 60 minutes
  - $\geq$ 60 minutes

- Six levels of Service Frequency: (details in Exhibit 5-3 of Ref [2] in page 5-7)
  - $\leq$ 18 hours
  - 15 to 18 hours
  - 12 to 14 hours
  - 7 to 11 hours
  - 4 to 6 hours
  - $\geq$ 4 hours

### 2.2 Access

- Walking is the **most common access** mode for urban public transit services
  - 50-80% of persons walk 1/4 mile or less to a local bus stop 
  - 50% of persons walk 1/2 mile or less to rail and BRT service
  - **Terrain, street connectivity, street-crossing difficulty are factors**

- Bicycling can extend a stop's market area
  - A person can cover **4 times** the distance in the same time, compared to walking

- Autos used in **lower-density areas** to access transit services when park-and-ride facilities are provided
  - Market area depends on area topography and access road network
  - Typical: **50% of demand comes from within 2.5 miles of lot**, 35% of demand comes from upstream up to 10 miles away from lot

### 2.3 Estimating the Service Coverage Area

#### (1) Planning level
- For bus stops: **air distance** within 400 m
- For rail or MRT: **air distance** within 800 m

#### (2) Refinement

$$
r_s = r_0 \cdot f_{sc} \cdot f_{g} \cdot f_{pop} \cdot f_{px}
$$
- where: $r_s$ transit stop service radius (mi, m)
  $r_0$ ideal transit stop service radius (mi, m)
  $r_0=$ 0.25 mi (400 m) for bus stops
  $r_0=$ 0.5 mi (800 m) for busway and rail stations
  $f_{sc}$ street connectivity factor
  $f_g$ grade factor
  $f_{pop}$ population factor
  $f_{px}$ pedestrian crossing factor

**Refinement for street connectivity**: $f_{sc}$
- Type 1: Grid, $f_{sc}=1.00$
- Type 2: Hybrid, $f_{sc}=0.85$
- Type 3: Cul-de-Sac (i.e., dead end), $f_{sc}=0.45$

**Refinement for terrain**: Grade factor $f_g$
-   0-5% : $f_g=1.00$
-   6-8% : $f_g=0.95$
-  9-11% : $f_g=0.80$
- 12-15% : $f_g=0.65$

**Refinement for population characteristics**: $f_{pop}$
- $f_{pop}=0.85$, if 20% or more of the boarding volume consists of **elderly pedestrians**

**Refinement for street crossing difficulty**: $f_{px}$
- Details in Exhibit 5-11 of Ref. [2] in page 5-16
- Pedestrians start to become impatient once crossing delay exceeds 30 s
- Pedestrian crossing factor $f_{px}$
  $$
  f_{px} = \sqrt{\frac{-0.0005 \, d_{ec}^2 - 0.1157 \, d_{ec} + 100}{100}}
  $$
  - where: $f_{px}$ is pedestrian crossing factor, and
    $d_{ec}$ is pedestrian crossing delay exceeding 30 s ($d_{ec} = d_p - 30$)
- Average pedestrian delay $d_p$
  $$
  d_p = \frac{(C -g_{walk})^2}{2 \, C} 
  $$
  - where $d_p$ is average pedestrian delay (s)
    $C$ is traffic signal cycle length (s)
    $g_{walk}$ is effective green time for pedestrians (WALK time + 4 s of flashing DON'T WALK)

At unsignalized pedestrian crossings, we estimate the average pedestrian delay by considering the factors (Details in Exhibit 5-12 of Ref. [2] in page 5-17):
- Crossing distance
- Average walking speed
- Traffic volumes (vehicle flow rates)

#### (3) Estimate Transit-supportive Area

Net acre vs Gross acre
- **Net acres** consider only the area developed for housing and employment
- **Gross acres** are the total land areas, including streets, parks, etc.

A household density of **3.0 units per gross acre** is a typical minimum residential density for **hourly daytime transit service** to be feasible.

An employment density of approximately **4 jobs per gross acre** produces the same level of ridership as a household density of 3.0 units per gross acre

#### (4) Service Coverage Area vs. Transit-Supportive Area: Four-step calculation procedure

**Step 1 :** Assemble data
- Transit stops and station locations from GIS database/public transport data system
- Traffic analysis zone (TAZ) data (households, jobs, and TAZ boundaries) from regional transportation planning model

**Step 2 :** Determine the service coverage area
- Bus stops are buffered using an adjusted radius (400 m is an ideal radius) and 
- Rail stations using an adjusted radius (800m is an ideal radius)

**Step 3 :** Determine the transit-supportive area
- Identify the TAZ areas with a **household density of 3.0 or more per acre**
- Identify the TAZ areas with a **job density of 4.0 or more per acre**

**Step 4 :** Compare Service Coverage Area to Transit-supportive Area

### 2.4 Service Coverage of Bicycle Access

- Five times faster than walking
  - A **2-km** radius for bus stop and a **4-km** radius for rail stations
  - These distances are much greater than the typical transit route spacing

- At system level:
  - Improving bicycle facilities and connectivity

- At a station level:
  - Bicycling conditions on access routes to the stops/stations
  - Bicycle parking capacity
  - Onboard bicycle storage

### 2.5 Service Coverage of Automobile Access

- One-half (50%) of a park-and-ride users start their trips within 3-5 km of the lot
- The outer market area can be scattered over an area **4 or more times** as large as the inner market area
- At planning level, **4-km radius** around larger Park & Ride (100 spaces or more) may be used as catchment area

### 2.6 Passenger Load

Details in Exhibit 5-16 of Ref. [2] in page 5-23 and Exhibit 5-17 of Ref. [2] in page 5-24 

- For transit vehicles designed for **mostly seated passengers**:
  - Load factor (passengers per seat)
    Example: Buses, ferries, commuter rail

- For transit vehicles designed for **mostly standing passengers**:
  - Average standing passenger space (square meters per
    passenger)
    Example: MTR/metro
  - A trade off between transit agency costs (e.g., increased frequency, larger vehicle) and passenger comfort

### 2.7 Reliability

#### (1) On-Time Performance Ratio

**Definition:** The percent of schedule deviations that fall within a defined range (i.e., between 2 min earlier arrive on time 5 min later of scheduled headway)

**Note:** Suitable for measuring transit services running at **longer headways** (e.g., 10 min or more)

#### (2) Headway Adherence Ratio

**Definition:** The regularity of transit vehicle arrivals with respect to the scheduled headway for a given time period

**Measurement:**
$$
C_{vh} = \frac{\text{stand deviation of } \boldsymbol{\rm actual} \text{ headways}}{\text{average } \boldsymbol{\rm scheduled} \text{ headway}}
$$

**Note:** Suitable for measuring transit services running at **shorter headways** (e.g., 10 min or less)

#### (3) Excess Waiting Time (EWT) of the Luckiest Passenger

**Definition:** Extra wait time compare to what was promised in the schedule at a station/stop

**Example:**
- time table
  - 3.55 p.m. : 2% departure
  - 4:00 p.m. : scheduled departure
  - 4:02 p.m. : actual departure
  - 4:10 p.m. : 95% departure

- excess time:
  - excess wait time: 4:00-4:02
  - excess platform wait time: 3.55-4:00
  - potential wait time: 4:00-4:10
  - excess budgeted wait time: 3.55-4:10

### 2.8 Comfort and Convenience

#### (1) Safety and Security
- Accident rate (preventable or non-preventable)
- Passenger safety (injuries or fatalities per time period)
- Percent positive drug and alcohol tests
- Number of traffic tickets/percent of buses exceeding speed limit
- Number of station overruns
- Number of fires
- Number of crimes
- Ratio of police officers to transit vehicles
- Percent of vehicles equipped with safety devices

#### (2) Customer Service
- Direct measurement of agency services
  - Percent of missed phone calls
  - Percent of calls held excessively long
  - Customer service response time
- Tracking customer compliments and complaints
  - Web-based forms/E-mail/Hotline/Postage-paid card
  - Customers should receive feedback promptly
- Customer satisfaction survey


## 3. Case Study of Singapore

### 3.1 Government Bus Contracting Model

- The roles of land transport authority (LTA)
  - In possession of all bus assets (e.g., buses, depots, interchanges)
  - In charge of bus service planning and standards setting
  - Retain all fare revenue

- The roles of operators
  - Run bus services in accordance with **specified standards**
  - Receive **a fixed service fee** independent of its operational cost
  - Up to 10% of its annual service fee will be rewarded or deducted according to the **Quality Incentive Scheme**

### 3.2 LTA assesses the operator's performance in the following aspects
  - **Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF)**: Excess Wait Time and On-Time Adherence
  - First and Last Bus Punctuality
  - Bus Maintenance
  - Bus Interchange and Bus Depot Maintenance
  - But Ticketing System Maintenance

#### (1) BSRF: Average Excess Waiting Time of Passengers at an AITP

- AITP: Assessment Intermediate Timing Point : $I = \{1,2, \cdots, i, \cdots, m \}$

- During a time period, a set of headways : $J = \{1,2, \cdots, j, \cdots,n \}$

- Average Scheduled waiting time (ASWT) at AITP $i$
$$
\text{ASWT} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\text{scheduled headway at AITP } i)^2}{2 \times \sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{scheduled headway at AITP } i}
$$

- Average Actual waiting time (AAWT) at AITP $i$
$$
\text{AAWT} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\text{actual headway at AITP } i)^2}{2 \times \sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{actual headway at AITP } i}
$$

- Average Excess Waiting Time (AEWT)
$$
\text{AEWT} = \text{AAWT} - \text{ASWT}
$$

#### (2) BSRF: Average Excess Waiting Time of Passengers

#### (3) BSRF: On-time Performance Ratio

$$
\frac{\text{No. of on-time buses}}{\text{Total No. of scheduled buses}} \geq 85\%
$$
#### (3) First and Last Bus Punctuality
- Evaluated for **each direction** of a bus service on a **daily basis**
- No earlier than the specified time and no more than 5 min later

#### (4) Bus Fleet Maintenance
- Scheduled and ad-hoc compliance audits
- Vehicle inspections and a review of repair and servicing records
- **Maintenance Audit Rating (MAR)** is evaluated on a **monthly basis**

#### (5) Bus Interchange and Depot Maintenance
- Maintenance Audit Rating (MAR) is evaluated on a **Quarterly basis**

#### (6) Bus Ticketing System Maintenance
- The **three-monthly moving** commuters' Over-Deduction Claim versus Ridership for the Operator shall be less than 0.0008%
- The availability of the Depot Computer System and WLAN system shall be **greater than 97%** per month
$$
\text{Availability} = \frac{\text{Monthly operating time} - \text{Monthly downtime}}{\text{Monthly operating time}}
$$
